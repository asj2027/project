letter.info = <p>Gallery Press has been engaged in many activities for the Korean art world since its approval as an art museum specialist. \
In particular, despite the harsh reality of the domestic culture and arts community, we are always striving to create an atmosphere where artists who do not mind the difficult path of art and physical education can actively encourage their work activities. </p>\
<p>Now, I think that in order for the Korean art world to be recognized internationally, Korean works and artists should be given a wide range of activities such as Europe, the United States, and Japan. \
Gallery Press believes that finding competent artists and supporting their activities is an important task for the museum. \
In addition, we hope to create an atmosphere where we can break away from imitation of foreign art trends and form our own unique art culture and grow on our own.</p> \
<p>Gallery Nour is trying to 'revive the Korean art world' by expanding their activities to artists. \
I will consider and try various ways to press gallery so that Korean artists and their works can be recognized from the general public to the world stage.</p>
